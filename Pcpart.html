  <h1> What Each Part Does:</h1>
    <h2> Power Supply</h2>    
     The power suppy is the hardware responsible for powering the computer.<br>
     Without a power supply, a computer won't even turn on. If you are looking <br>     
     to build a pc on a budget, a good choice wood be the EVGA 500w. For a more <br>
     advanced pc, any of the modular Corsair power supplies would be ideal, as <br> <img src="http://www.guoguiyan.com/data/out/145/70138784-pc-wallpapers.jpeg" alt border="0.000001" width="700" height="400" align="right">
     they are some of the best on the market. 

  <h2> CPU </h2> 
     The CPU is sort of the brains of the computer. It handles most of the <br>   
     complex processes that happen within the computer. For instance, without<br>
     a cpu, no mouse or keyboard clicks would even be registered and the<br>    
     computer would basically be rendered completely useless. A good cpu would <br>
     either be the Intel i5 6700k or the AMD Ryzen 1600.

  <h2> GPU</h2>
    In terms of gaming pc's, the gpu is probably the most important part. <br> 
    The GPU is responsible for the processing of all graphical functions <br>
    taking place within games and other processes. A good gpu for a budget <br>
    would be the AMD Radeon RX 480 or Nvidia GTX 1060. I really good higher <br>
    end gpu would definitely be the GTX 1080.

  <h2> Motherboard</h2>

    For a novice pc builder, the motherboard of a pc is quite a sight to behold <br>
    because of how complicated it looks. To put it simple, all a motherboard does <br> <img src="http://humanepursuits.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/technology1.jpg" alt border="0.000001" width="700" height="400" align="right">
    is route the power from the power supply to all the parts of the pc. It's <br>
    impossible to reccomend a single motherboard because it really depends on what <br>
    cpu you have. A good motherboard brand, however, is Gigabyte or Asus.

  <h2> Memory</h2>

    The memory is probably the easiest part of a pc for a beginner to understand. <br>
    It basically stores information that you are using right now, like how many <br>
    tabs you have open  or what you are writing in word dcument to be later <br>
    put into your hard drives. All RAM is basicall the same, but make sure <br>
    to get at least 8 GB of it. 

  <h2> Hard drives</h2>

    Hard drives are where all of your information is stored. There are two types of <br>
    Drives: Solid State Drives (SSD) or or just regular hard drives. SSD's are much <br>
    faster than hard drives but they are much more expensive. On budget, most people <br>
    can't afford an ssd, but if you can afford one, ssd's are great for boot drives. <br>
    Gaming pcs also need at least a terabyte of space.

  <h2> Case</h2>

    The case for a pc is very simple. It basically just holds all of the parts together <br>
    in one place. Without a case, all the parts would be open to the elements and it <br>
    would look pretty ugly. The case is the main thing that can either make a pc look <br>
    super ugly or super sexy. NZXT and Corsair are both good PC case brands. <br>
